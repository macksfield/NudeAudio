A responsive slider for integrating into themes via a simple shortcode.

== Description ==

The *Responsive Slider* plugin allows you to create slides that consist of linked (to any url) images and titles. The slider would then take those slides and present them as a jQuery-powered slideshow - at a chosen location within your theme, page, or post. In whatever order you want them.

**[See the Demo](http://demo.alienwp.com/responsive-slider/)**

The main purpose of the *Responsive Slider* is to serve as an effective addition to **responsive WordPress themes**, as it would automatically adjust to its container. This would work out of the box - there is no need for additional CSS or JavaScript tweaks from your theme.

[How to Install and Use the plugin?](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/responsive-slider/installation/)
Make sure to read the plugin documentation in `docs/readme.html` as well.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder `responsive-slider` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress. A new item **"Slides"** would appear in the admin menu (under "Pages"). 
1. Go to **Slides -> Settings** and configure the slider options.
1. Go to **Slides -> Add New Slide** and create a few slides.
1. Place `<?php echo do_shortcode( '[responsive_slider]' ); ?>` in your template - wherever you want it displayed. Alternatively you can use `[responsive_slider]` into a post or a page - just like any other shortcode.
1. That's it. Your site should now display the slider at the chosen location.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My slider disappeared when I upgraded!? =

Make sure to use `<?php echo do_shortcode( '[responsive_slider]' ); ?>` instead of `<?php do_shortcode( '[responsive_slider]' ); ?>` if you are adding the slider directly to your template file.

= But the slider is not responsive! =

The slider addapts to it's container width. If you are using a theme with non-responsive layout, the slider won't behave 'responsively' as well.

= Would the Responsive Slider work in my theme? =

The plugin has been tested with more than 20 popular WordPress themes. It should work in yours too.

= Does my theme need to be 'responsive' in order to use this plugin? =

No, not at all. You can use it with any theme.

= Can I change the way it looks? =

Sure, you can easily override the slider CSS in your theme. The easiest approach is to use a tool like Firebug to find the snippet you need to override. Then copy it to your theme CSS file (usually `style.css`) and edit it there, using a CSS selector with higher priority.

= Can I create more than one slider? =
No, currently the plugin can maintain only one slider.
