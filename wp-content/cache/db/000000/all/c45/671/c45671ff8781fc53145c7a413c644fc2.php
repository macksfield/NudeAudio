<hr />
SAN FRANCISCO, July 22, 2013 ‚Äî NudeAudio, a new generation audio company whose founders have deep roots in product design, fashion and audio manufacturing, announce their global launch today with a range of portable speakers designed to fit listeners‚Äô various size, sound and ease-of-use needs.
 
A truly international brand, with design headquartered in San Francisco, operations headquartered in Hong Kong, and sales headquartered in High Wycombe, outside of London, NudeAudio‚Äôs first offering is the MOVE line ‚Äî portable Bluetooth speakers designed for people who believe that a premium audio experience and an affordable one shouldn‚Äôt be mutually exclusive.
 
Peter Riering-Czekalla, Chief Design Officer, states, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve considered and challenged every detail. It‚Äôs as much about what we decided not to do, as it is about what we chose to embody in our products. Just because you can, doesn‚Äôt mean you should ‚Äî design takes restraint.‚Äù He continued to say, ‚ÄúIn order to deliver premium products at affordable prices, our approach is all about focusing on what matters most: streamlined features and functionality, aesthetic simplicity and prioritizing acoustics over marketing.‚Äù
 
One of the most distinctive design cues is a brightly colored carrying cord, available on all MOVE models, to emphasize and encourage ease of transport and the joys of sharing music, video, gaming and other audio-related experiences with those around you.  
 
The MOVE range features four speaker models and is currently available in two color sets: charcoal grey/coral, and light grey/mint. Borrowing from the fashion industry, the line comes in three sizes: S, M and L. The ‚ÄúMove S‚Äù is an ultra-portable pocket-sized version, which comes in both a Bluetooth and a 3.5mm variant. The ‚ÄúMove M‚Äù takes things up a notch in terms of both size and bass, and the ‚ÄúMove L‚Äù offers the range‚Äôs biggest size, which fills an entire room with rich, warm sound. All models come with a thick, durable silicone sleeve that‚Äôs both tactile and protective.
 
What makes the range particularly noteworthy is its dedication to high-quality sound and design while also being as economical and thoughtful about every decision, to deliver excellent standards at an approachable price point.

The MOVE line will be available from leading audio retailers starting in mid-August, 2013. Strategic retail partners in each region include DSG in the UK, XXX in the US, XXX in XXX.
The STUDIO line, a range of speakers for the home, is on track to launch from NudeAudio toward the end of this year. Stay tuned.

Chief Marketing Officer, Tom Old adds, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thrilled to be able to put a line of speakers out on the market that can compete with the leading audio brands out there today ‚Äî at a lower cost to consumers. The category has seen a spike in over-premiumization, and we‚Äôd like to challenge that.‚Äù
 
Old continues with a few thoughts about today‚Äôs audio behaviors: ‚ÄúBluetooth speakers are now the most popular technology format and the preferred way for people to listen to music out loud from their smartphone or tablet. The benefits are obvious as it allows the phone to stay in close proximity of the user, so they can use other functions e.g. mail or Facebook while simultaneously listening to their music.‚Äù
 
NudeAudio CEO, Tom Dudderidge elaborates about the brand itself: "The Nude name embodies the values that have been central to everything we‚Äôve done from the very start and that‚Äôs to be minimal, simple and transparent while at the same time offering something refreshingly unexpected. We are extremely excited to bring NudeAudio to the world. This isn‚Äôt just another speaker.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúWe began with a blank canvas in order to bring a genuinely fresh design sensibility and norm-challenging approach to the traditional CE industry. Our mantra is ‚Äòpassionate about design, serious about sound.‚Äô Delivering on that promise is our key motivation. In addition to the positive feedback we‚Äôve received thus far, we hope that it will become self evident when you see ‚Äî and hear ‚Äî the products for yourself.‚Äù

<strong>A fashion and design orientated portable speaker range for everybody - NudeAudio</strong>

SAN FRANCISCO, 7th August, 2013 ‚Äî NudeAudio, a new-generation audio company whose founders have deep roots in product design, fashion and audio manufacturing, today announces the launch of the NudeAudio brand and the global introduction of their debut collection of four portable speakers under the Move range. Retailing between ¬£19.99 and ¬£99.99, the three Bluetooth speakers and 3.5mm speaker will be available this August from leading consumer electronics retailers including HMV, Currys, Amazon and Very.co.uk in the UK.

The portable speakers that are designed to fit listener‚Äôs various, size and sound needs and all feature NudeAudio‚Äôs signature combination of clean, contemporary design and great sound. The range launches in two colourways: charcoal/coral and grey/mint, both of which subtly reference the ‚Äòon trend‚Äô hues of the sports-fashion industry. The naming of the speakers makes another playful nod to the clothing world as the speakers are named S, M and L. 

The ‚ÄúMove S‚Äù is an ultra-portable pocket-sized version, which comes in both a Bluetooth and a 3.5mm wired variant. ‚ÄúMove M‚Äù takes things up a notch in terms of both size and bass, and the ‚ÄúMove L‚Äù offers the range‚Äôs biggest size, filling an entire room with a rich, warm sound. 

One of the most distinctive design cues is a brightly colored carrying cord, available on all Move models, to emphasize and encourage ease of transport and the joys of sharing music, video, gaming and other audio-related experiences with those around you.  All the speakers also come with a thick, durable silicone sleeve that is both tactile and protective.

The Bluetooth speakers use 3.0 Bluetooth Technology and will stream music from any smartphone, tablet and most computers from a 10m or 30ft distance, allowing users to have complete control from the palm of their hand. Each of the speakers has an eight-hour battery life.

Peter Riering-Czekalla, the San Francisco based CDO (Chief Design Officer) enthused: ‚ÄúDuring the design process, we‚Äôve considered and challenged every detail. It‚Äôs as much about what we decided not to do, as it is about what we chose to embody in our products. In order to deliver premium products at affordable prices, our approach is all about focusing on what matters most: streamlined features and functionality, aesthetic simplicity and prioritizing acoustics over marketing.‚Äù

Chief Marketing Officer, Tom Old adds, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thrilled to be able to put a line of fashion inspired speakers out on the market that can compete with the leading audio brands out there today ‚Äî at a lower cost to consumers. The category has seen a glut of over-priced product, and we‚Äôd like to challenge that.‚Äù

<b>4<sup>th</sup> February, San Francisco</b>. NudeAudio, the design focused audio company is pleased to announce the launch of their first home speaker - Studio 5. ¬†Breaking the mould of traditional speaker design, the iconic looking, asymmetric speaker features both Bluetooth and an Apple Lightning connector, making it compatible with all smartphones and tablets. The home speaker houses a powerful 2.1 system capable of delivering rich, crisp, high fidelity sound.

Tom Old Co-Founder enthused ‚ÄúStudio 5 is very different to other home speakers in the market. We‚Äôve really spent time considering how and where the speaker is going to be used. People don‚Äôt just want a speaker to sound good, they‚Äôre asking for a speaker that compliments the aesthetics of their home interior too. Gone are the days of design-conscious consumers accepting a black plastic box into their home.‚Äù

Studio 5 has been designed to compliment a chic, contemporary home interior. Real metal elements accompany fabric and soft touch paint on the asymmetric housing; creating a refined, yet bold form. The play-control buttons are subtly hidden in the circular dock-plate and the iPad support is made of transparent polycarbonate.

While the colour pallet is quiet, the acoustics are anything but. The 3 inch subwoofer and two high-fidelity neodymium-drivers work in perfect harmony to deliver a high-resolution sound that stretches from 70Hz ~ 18kHz. Three pre-set bass settings allow users to beef up or down the speaker according to the genre of music and personal taste.

The speaker provides a variety of connection options. For the latest iPhone and iPad variants, you can play and charge with an Apple Lightning connector. Along with aux-in, the speaker also features a CSR Bluetooth chipset, which provides a quick and reliable Bluetooth connection. Impressively, Dual-pairing over Bluetooth is possible enabling two devices to be connected at the same time - music can then be switched between devices by simply pressing pause and play.

For the technically savvy, NudeAudio has also included AptX (Advanced Digital Signal Processing) coding technology. When using the NudeAudio Studio 5 with other AptX compatible devices (e.g. any Mac with OSX or Samsung Galaxy S4 Smartphones or newer), the audio is CD quality and indistinguishable to a wired source.

The speaker retails at $179.99 and can be bought from Grand Street (<a href="https://grandst.com/p/studio5">https://grandst.com/p/studio5</a>) and Amazon. Further national home ware stores will be announced in the coming months.
<ul>
	<li>Play and charge compatible iPod, iPhone and iPad models with Lightning connector including iPhone 5, iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C, iPod touch 5<sup>th</sup> Gen and iPad mini</li>
	<li>2.1 Stereo speaker with 3 inch subwoofer, bass port and bass control</li>
	<li>Dual pairing Bluetooth wireless technology</li>
	<li>Experience the full integrity of original digital audio with the AptX¬Æ Bluetooth codec (when using compatible devices)</li>
	<li>Aux-in for use with other smartphones, tablets and music players</li>
